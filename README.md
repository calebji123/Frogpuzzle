# NAME IN PROGRESS [Frogame]

Caleb's skinned version of frogame, forked from fmwofmwmf's repository. Idea co-created.

NAME IN PROGRESS [Frogame] is a puzzle game inspired by all the block moving puzzle games before. It takes the twist that the character is actually a frog that cannot move on its own, but rather relies on its toungue to pull objects toward it and pull itself towards objects. NAME IN PROGRESS [Frogame] is an exercise on puzzle creation and balancing fun and difficult levels. More mechanics and levels will come with time.
